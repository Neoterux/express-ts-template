Express & Typescript project
----------------------------

This repository contains a basic configuration of an express application
that would be written using typescript features.

### Linters & Formatters

This project is pre-configured to use `eslint` and `prettier` to work as 
linter and formatter, respectively.

### Package managers

The initial setup is based on `Yarn` and maybe be changed to another Package Manager.
But that's your responsibility.
